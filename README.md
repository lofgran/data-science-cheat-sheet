# About This Document

I began creating this document with the intent to use it as a reference to common programming tasks knowing early on that I’d want to re-use bits and pieces of code. Thus far I’ve found package documentation to be exceptional but inefficiently slow. Hence, the scope of this document isn’t to replace documentation, but rather provide structure to approaches for solving common problems.
